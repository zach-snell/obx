The `analyze-vault` MCP tool acts as a diagnostics and health-check engine.

## Actions

- `stats`: Returns aggregate file counts and sizes.
- `broken-links`: Scans for wikilinks pointing to missing files.
- `orphan-notes`: Finds files with zero incoming or outgoing connections.
- `unlinked-mentions`: Suggests words in a note that exactly match another note's title.
- `find-stubs`: Finds notes with extremely low word counts.
- `find-outdated`: Finds files that haven't been touched in a very long time.
