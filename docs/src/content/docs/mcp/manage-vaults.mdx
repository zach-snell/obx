description: Dynamically rotate the active vault handled by the server without restarting.

The `manage-vaults` MCP tool is only loaded if the `obx mcp` process is launched with the `--allow-vault-switching` flag. It enables the AI assistant to swap workspaces over the wire.

## Actions

- `list`: Returns the currently active vault and an array of `--allowed-vaults` aliases.
- `switch`: Unmounts the current vault and mounts a new one from the allowed alias pool.
