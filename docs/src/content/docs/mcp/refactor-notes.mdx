The `refactor-notes` MCP tool provides structural refactoring operations for reorganising your vault.

## Actions

- `split`: Break a single note into multiple new notes at each heading of a given level. Optionally keep or remove the original content.
- `merge`: Combine several notes into one output file, with configurable separators and optional heading insertion.
- `extract-section`: Pull a specific heading and its body out of a note into a new file, optionally leaving a link in the source.
