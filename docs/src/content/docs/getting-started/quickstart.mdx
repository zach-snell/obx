This guide will help you set up obsidian-go-mcp and start using it with your AI assistant.

## Prerequisites

- An Obsidian vault (or any folder with markdown files)
- An MCP-compatible AI client (Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.)

## Setup

<Steps>

1. **Install obsidian-go-mcp**

   <Tabs>
     <TabItem label="macOS/Linux">
       ```bash
       curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zach-snell/obsidian-go-mcp/main/install.sh | bash
       ```
     </TabItem>
     <TabItem label="Homebrew">
       ```bash
       brew install zach-snell/tap/obsidian-go-mcp
       ```
     </TabItem>
     <TabItem label="Go">
       ```bash
       go install github.com/zach-snell/obsidian-go-mcp@latest
       ```
     </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

2. **Find your vault path**

   Your Obsidian vault is just a folder. Find the path:
   - **macOS**: `/Users/yourname/Documents/MyVault`
   - **Linux**: `/home/yourname/Documents/MyVault`
   - **Windows**: `C:\Users\yourname\Documents\MyVault`

3. **Configure your MCP client**

   Add to your Claude Desktop config (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "obsidian": {
         "command": "obsidian-go-mcp",
         "args": ["/path/to/your/vault"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Restart your AI client**

   Close and reopen Claude Desktop (or your MCP client) to load the new server.

5. **Start chatting!**

   You can now ask your AI assistant to interact with your vault.

</Steps>

## First Commands to Try

Once configured, try asking your AI assistant:

### Read your vault

> "Show me my 10 most recently modified notes"

> "What notes do I have in my projects folder?"

### Search for content

> "Search for notes mentioning 'machine learning'"

> "Find all notes tagged with #book-notes"

### Create content

> "Create a new daily note for today"

> "Add a task to my inbox: Review quarterly goals"

### Analyze your vault

> "Show me statistics about my vault"

> "Find orphan notes that aren't linked anywhere"

## Example Conversation

Here's a typical interaction:

**You**: "Create a new project note for 'Website Redesign' with status draft and priority high"

**Assistant**: *Uses `write-note` and `set-frontmatter` tools*

> Created `projects/Website Redesign.md` with:
> - Status: draft
> - Priority: high

**You**: "Add a checklist of tasks for this project"

**Assistant**: *Uses `append-note` tool*

> Added tasks to the note:
> - [ ] Define requirements
> - [ ] Create wireframes
> - [ ] Design mockups
> - [ ] Implement frontend
> - [ ] Test and deploy
