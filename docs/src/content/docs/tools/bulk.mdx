description: Batch operations on multiple notes at once.
---

Bulk operations let you modify many notes in a single action, saving time on repetitive tasks.

## Available Tools

### bulk-tag

Add or remove a tag from multiple notes.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `paths` | string | Yes | Comma-separated paths or JSON array |
| `tag` | string | Yes | Tag to add/remove (with or without #) |
| `action` | string | No | Action: add, remove (default: add) |

Tags are added to frontmatter if it exists, otherwise as inline tags.

**Example prompts:**
- "Add #archive tag to all notes in the old-projects folder"
- "Tag these 5 notes with #review-needed"
- "Remove the #draft tag from all published articles"

---

### bulk-move

Move multiple notes to a folder.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `paths` | string | Yes | Comma-separated paths or JSON array |
| `destination` | string | Yes | Destination folder path |
| `update_links` | boolean | No | Update wikilinks (default: true) |

**Example prompts:**
- "Move all completed project notes to the archive folder"
- "Move these meeting notes to meetings/2024/"
- "Relocate draft articles to the drafts folder"

---

### bulk-set-frontmatter

Set a frontmatter property on multiple notes.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `paths` | string | Yes | Comma-separated paths or JSON array |
| `key` | string | Yes | Frontmatter property key |
| `value` | string | Yes | Property value to set |

**Example prompts:**
- "Set status=archived on all notes in old-projects/"
- "Mark these 10 notes as reviewed=true"
- "Set author='John Doe' on all my blog posts"

## Specifying Multiple Paths

### Comma-separated

```
path1.md, path2.md, folder/path3.md
```

### JSON array

```json
["path1.md", "path2.md", "folder/path3.md"]
```

### From search results

Combine with search tools:

> "Find all notes tagged #draft, then add the #needs-review tag to them"

The AI will:
1. Run `search-by-tags` with `tags=draft`
2. Run `bulk-tag` with the resulting paths

## Common Workflows

### Archiving Old Projects

> "Move all notes in projects/2023/ to archive/ and tag them with #archived"

```
1. bulk-move: projects/2023/*.md → archive/
2. bulk-tag: add #archived to moved notes
```

### Batch Status Update

> "Set status=published on all notes currently marked as final-review"

```
1. query-frontmatter: status=final-review
2. bulk-set-frontmatter: status=published on results
```

### Organizing by Topic

> "Find all notes mentioning 'machine learning' and move them to ml/ folder"

```
1. search-vault: 'machine learning'
2. bulk-move: results → ml/
```

### Cleanup Campaign

> "Remove the #todo tag from all completed tasks"

```
1. search-by-tags: todo
2. Filter to completed items
3. bulk-tag: remove #todo
```

## Best Practices

### Preview Before Bulk Operations

Ask the AI to show you what will be affected:

> "Show me which notes would be tagged if I add #archive to old-projects/"

### Use Specific Paths

Be explicit about which notes to modify:

> "Add #important to only these three notes: project-a.md, project-b.md, project-c.md"

### Combine with Search

Use search tools to build your list:

> "Find notes modified before 2023 in the drafts folder, then move them to archive"

### Check Results

After bulk operations, verify:

> "Show me all notes with the #archive tag to confirm the operation"

## Safety Notes

- **Link updates**: `bulk-move` updates wikilinks by default
- **No undo**: Operations are immediate; consider backup
- **Frontmatter creation**: `bulk-set-frontmatter` creates frontmatter if needed
- **Tag format**: Tags are normalized (# is added/removed as needed)

## Examples with AI

### Complex reorganization

**You**: "I want to reorganize my vault. Find all notes about Python, tag them with #python, and move any that are tutorials to a python/tutorials/ folder."

**AI**: 
1. Searches for Python-related notes
2. Tags all results with #python
3. Identifies tutorials (by content or existing tags)
4. Moves tutorials to python/tutorials/
5. Reports: "Tagged 15 notes with #python, moved 6 tutorials"

### Metadata standardization

**You**: "Set type=reference on all notes in my reference/ folder that don't have a type field"

**AI**:
1. Lists notes in reference/
2. Checks frontmatter of each
3. Applies type=reference where missing
4. Reports: "Updated 23 notes with type=reference"
