Graph tools help you understand and improve the connections between notes in your vault.

## Link Analysis

### backlinks

Find all notes that link to a given note.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `path` | string | Yes | Path to the note |

**Example prompts:**
- "What notes link to my 'Python' note?"
- "Show backlinks to the project overview"
- "Who references this concept?"

---

### forward-links

Show outgoing links from a note.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `path` | string | Yes | Path to the note |

**Example prompts:**
- "What does this note link to?"
- "Show all outgoing links from my index"
- "What topics does this article reference?"

## Vault Health

### orphan-notes

Find notes with no links to or from them.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `directory` | string | No | Limit to specific directory |
| `include_no_outgoing` | boolean | No | Also show dead ends (no outgoing links) |

Orphan notes are disconnected from your knowledge graph.

**Example prompts:**
- "Find orphan notes in my vault"
- "Show isolated notes that need linking"
- "Find dead-end notes with no outgoing links"

---

### broken-links

Find wikilinks pointing to non-existent notes.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `directory` | string | No | Limit to specific directory |

Helps identify notes you intended to create or typos in links.

**Example prompts:**
- "Find all broken links in my vault"
- "Show wikilinks to missing notes"
- "What notes am I planning to write?"

## Link Suggestions

### unlinked-mentions

Find text matching a note's name that isn't linked.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `path` | string | Yes | Path to the note |

Finds places where a concept is mentioned but not linked.

**Example prompts:**
- "Find unlinked mentions of 'Python'"
- "Where is 'Machine Learning' mentioned but not linked?"
- "Show potential links to this note"

---

### suggest-links

Suggest notes that should be linked based on content.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `path` | string | Yes | Path to the note |
| `limit` | number | No | Maximum suggestions (default: 10) |

Analyzes note content and suggests relevant connections.

**Example prompts:**
- "Suggest links for this note"
- "What should I link to from this article?"
- "Find related notes I could connect to"

## Use Cases

### Knowledge Graph Maintenance

Regular maintenance workflow:

1. **Find orphans**: `orphan-notes` reveals disconnected notes
2. **Fix broken links**: `broken-links` shows missing targets
3. **Add connections**: `suggest-links` recommends new links
4. **Convert mentions**: `unlinked-mentions` finds implicit references

### Understanding a Topic

Explore a concept:

1. **See what links here**: `backlinks` shows notes about this topic
2. **See what it links to**: `forward-links` shows related concepts
3. **Find more connections**: `suggest-links` discovers hidden relationships

### Example Workflow

> "Help me improve the connectivity of my 'Machine Learning' note"

The AI might:

1. Run `backlinks` - "5 notes link to Machine Learning"
2. Run `forward-links` - "It links to 3 notes"
3. Run `unlinked-mentions` - "Found 12 unlinked mentions"
4. Run `suggest-links` - "Suggest linking to: Neural Networks, Deep Learning, TensorFlow"

## Graph Metrics

### vault-stats

Includes graph statistics when run:

- Total notes and links
- Average links per note
- Most linked notes
- Orphan count

**Example prompts:**
- "Show me vault statistics including link analysis"
- "How connected is my vault?"
