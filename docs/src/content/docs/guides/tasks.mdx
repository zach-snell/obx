obsidian-go-mcp provides tools to manage Markdown checkbox tasks across your vault.

## Task Format

Tasks are standard Markdown checkboxes:

```markdown
- [ ] Open task
- [x] Completed task
```

### Extended Task Syntax

Many users add metadata to tasks:

```markdown
- [ ] Review PR #123 #work @john 📅 2024-03-15
- [ ] Buy groceries #personal ⏰ 17:00
- [x] Submit report ✅ 2024-03-10
```

obsidian-go-mcp recognizes and preserves this syntax.

## Task Tools

### list-tasks

List all tasks across your vault.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `status` | string | Filter: all, open, completed (default: all) |
| `directory` | string | Limit to specific directory |

**Example prompts:**
- "Show all my open tasks"
- "List completed tasks in projects/"
- "What tasks do I have?"

### toggle-task

Toggle a task's completion status.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `path` | string | Path to the note |
| `line` | number | Line number of the task (1-based) |

**Example prompts:**
- "Mark the third task in inbox.md as done"
- "Complete the task on line 15"

## Common Workflows

### Daily Task Review

<Steps>

1. **View open tasks**
   > "Show me all open tasks"

2. **Filter by context**
   > "Just show tasks tagged with #work"

3. **Complete tasks**
   > "Mark the first three tasks as done"

4. **Add new tasks**
   > "Add a task to my inbox: Review quarterly report"

</Steps>

### Inbox Processing

Process tasks from a central inbox:

> "Show tasks in my inbox, then help me distribute them to the right projects"

The AI will:
1. List tasks from inbox.md
2. Help categorize each task
3. Move relevant tasks to project notes
4. Keep inbox clean

### Project Task Tracking

Track tasks within a project:

> "Show all tasks in my 'Website Redesign' project"

```
list-tasks: directory=projects/Website Redesign
```

## Task Organization Patterns

### Centralized Inbox

Keep a single inbox for quick capture:

```markdown
# Inbox

- [ ] Call dentist
- [ ] Review PR #456
- [ ] Research GraphQL
```

Process regularly with:
> "Help me process my inbox - categorize tasks and move them to appropriate notes"

### Project-Based Tasks

Tasks live in project notes:

```markdown
# Website Redesign

## Tasks
- [ ] Create wireframes
- [ ] Review with stakeholders
- [x] Define requirements

## Notes
...
```

### Daily Note Tasks

Tasks in daily notes:

```markdown
# 2024-03-15

## Tasks for Today
- [ ] Morning standup
- [ ] Code review
- [ ] Deploy to staging
```

## Finding Tasks

### By Tag

> "Find all tasks tagged with #urgent"

Uses `search-vault` with task checkbox pattern + tag.

### By Project

> "Show tasks in the marketing project"

Uses `list-tasks` with directory filter.

### By Date

> "Find tasks due this week"

Searches for date patterns in task text.

### Overdue Tasks

> "Find tasks with dates before today that aren't completed"

The AI parses dates and filters results.

## Task Metadata Patterns

### Priority

```markdown
- [ ] 🔴 Critical bug fix
- [ ] 🟡 Medium priority feature
- [ ] 🟢 Nice to have improvement
```

Or with tags:
```markdown
- [ ] Fix login bug #p1
- [ ] Add dark mode #p2
```

### Due Dates

```markdown
- [ ] Submit report 📅 2024-03-15
- [ ] Call client due::2024-03-20
```

### Assignments

```markdown
- [ ] Review code @john
- [ ] Write docs @sarah
```

### Context Tags

```markdown
- [ ] Call dentist #personal #phone
- [ ] Review PR #work #code-review
```

## Advanced Task Queries

### Combine Conditions

> "Find all open tasks tagged #work that are due this week"

### Group and Count

> "How many open tasks do I have per project?"

### Find Stale Tasks

> "Show tasks that have been open for more than 30 days"

## Task Reports

### Weekly Summary

> "Summarize tasks completed this week"

The AI will:
1. Search daily notes for the week
2. Find completed tasks
3. Group by project/tag
4. Generate summary

### Project Progress

> "Show task completion progress for the Website Redesign project"

```
Total: 25 tasks
Completed: 18 (72%)
Open: 7
```

<Aside type="tip">
Create a "Task Dashboard" note that links to your main task views. Ask the AI to update it periodically with current counts and priorities.

## Integration with Dataview

If you use Dataview, tasks can have inline fields:

```markdown
- [ ] Review code [due:: 2024-03-15] [priority:: high]
```

Query with:
> "Find tasks where priority is high"

Uses `query-inline-fields` to find matching tasks.

## Best Practices

### Keep Tasks Atomic

Bad:
```markdown
- [ ] Redesign entire website
```

Good:
```markdown
- [ ] Create homepage wireframe
- [ ] Design navigation component
- [ ] Build responsive header
```

### Use Consistent Syntax

Pick a format and stick with it:
```markdown
✓ - [ ] Task #tag 📅 date
✗ - [ ] Task (tag) - date
✗ - [ ] Task, tag, date
```

### Regular Processing

- Process inbox daily
- Review projects weekly
- Archive completed tasks monthly
