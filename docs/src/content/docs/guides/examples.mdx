This guide shows practical examples of using obx with AI assistants.

## Daily Workflows

### Morning Routine

**You**: "Set up my day - create today's daily note, show my open tasks, and list what I worked on yesterday"

The AI will:
1. Create/open today's daily note
2. Use `manage-tasks` with `action: "list"` and `status: "open"`
3. Read yesterday's daily note for context

---

### End of Day Review

**You**: "Help me wrap up - show tasks I completed today, move any unfinished ones to tomorrow, and summarize what I accomplished"

The AI will:
1. List today's completed tasks
2. Identify incomplete tasks
3. Append them to tomorrow's daily note
4. Generate a summary for today's note

---

### Weekly Review

**You**: "Start my weekly review - show all tasks completed this week, any open items, and notes I created"

The AI will:
1. Open/create the weekly note
2. List daily notes from the past 7 days
3. Aggregate completed tasks
4. Find notes created this week
5. Summarize in the weekly note

## Note Management

### Quick Capture

**You**: "Add to my inbox: Research GraphQL vs REST for the new API"

```
→ manage-notes action: "append", path: "inbox.md"
→ content: "- [ ] Research GraphQL vs REST for the new API"
```

---

### Create Structured Notes

**You**: "Create a new project note for 'Mobile App Redesign' with high priority, status planning, and due date March 15"

The AI will:
1. Create the note with `manage-notes` action: `"write"`
2. Set frontmatter with `manage-frontmatter` action: `"set"`:
   - `priority: high`
   - `status: planning`
   - `due: 2024-03-15`

---

### Find and Update

**You**: "Find my note about the Q4 budget and update the status to approved"

```
1. search-vault action: "search", query: "Q4 budget"
2. manage-frontmatter action: "set", path: "found/note.md", key: "status", value: "approved"
```

## Research Workflows

### Explore a Topic

**You**: "What do I know about machine learning? Show related notes and any gaps"

The AI will:
1. `search-vault` action: `"search"`, query: "machine learning"
2. `search-vault` action: `"tags"`, tags: "machine-learning"
3. `manage-links` action: `"backlinks"` on main ML note
4. `analyze-vault` action: `"orphan-notes"` to check for isolated ML content
5. `manage-links` action: `"suggest"` to find potential connections

---

### Build a Knowledge Map

**You**: "Create a MOC for my programming notes and connect it to my main index"

```
1. manage-mocs action: "generate", directory: "programming", output: "programming/Programming MOC.md"
2. manage-notes action: "append" — add link to main index
3. bulk-operations action: "tag" — add #moc tag to the MOC
```

---

### Find Gaps

**You**: "What concepts in my vault need more development?"

```
1. analyze-vault action: "find-stubs", max_words: 50
2. analyze-vault action: "broken-links" — find mentioned-but-not-created notes
3. analyze-vault action: "orphan-notes" — find disconnected content
```

## Task Management

### Review All Tasks

**You**: "Show me all open tasks grouped by priority"

The AI will use `manage-tasks` action: `"list"` and organize results by priority tags or frontmatter.

---

### Task Cleanup

**You**: "Find all tasks older than 30 days and mark them for review"

```
1. manage-tasks action: "list", status: "open"
2. Filter by date in task text or note modified date
3. bulk-operations action: "tag" — add #needs-review to affected notes
```

---

### Project Tasks

**You**: "Show all tasks in my 'Website Redesign' project"

```
1. search-vault action: "search", directory: "projects/Website Redesign"
2. manage-tasks action: "list", directory: "projects/Website Redesign"
```

## Content Organization

### Reorganize a Folder

**You**: "The 'misc' folder is getting cluttered. Help me organize it by topic"

The AI might:
1. List notes in misc/
2. Analyze content and tags
3. Suggest categorization
4. Create new folders
5. `bulk-operations` action: `"move"` notes to appropriate locations

---

### Clean Up Tags

**You**: "I have tags #todo, #TODO, and #to-do. Standardize them all to #todo"

```
1. search-vault action: "tags" — search each variant
2. For each note: Update tag format
3. Report: "Standardized 23 notes to use #todo"
```

---

### Archive Old Content

**You**: "Archive all notes in projects/ that haven't been modified in 6 months"

```
1. analyze-vault action: "find-outdated", days: 180, directory: "projects"
2. bulk-operations action: "move", destination: "archive/projects"
3. bulk-operations action: "set-frontmatter", key: "status", value: "archived"
4. bulk-operations action: "tag", tag: "#archived"
```

## Meeting Notes

### Before a Meeting

**You**: "Prepare for my meeting with the design team - create a note from the meeting template and pull in context from recent design discussions"

```
1. manage-templates action: "apply", template: "meeting", path: "meetings/Design Team 2024-01-15.md"
2. search-vault action: "search", query: "design"
3. manage-notes action: "append" — add relevant context to meeting note
```

---

### After a Meeting

**You**: "Extract action items from today's meeting notes and create tasks"

The AI will:
1. Read the meeting note
2. Identify action items (lines starting with "- [ ]" or "Action:")
3. Optionally distribute to relevant project notes

## Advanced Workflows

### Content Pipeline

**You**: "Show me all draft articles ready for review"

```
search-vault action: "frontmatter", query: "status=draft"
→ Filter by: word count > 500, has all required sections
→ Present list for review
```

---

### Cross-Reference Check

**You**: "Are there any notes that mention 'API' but don't link to my API documentation?"

```
1. search-vault: "API"
2. For each result: check if it links to API-docs.md
3. Report unlinked mentions
4. Optionally: Add links
```

---

### Vault Health Check

**You**: "Run a full health check on my vault"

The AI will:
1. `analyze-vault` action: `"stats"` — overall metrics
2. `analyze-vault` action: `"orphan-notes"` — disconnected content
3. `analyze-vault` action: `"broken-links"` — missing link targets
4. `analyze-vault` action: `"find-stubs"` — underdeveloped notes
5. `analyze-vault` action: `"find-outdated"` — stale content
6. Report findings and suggest improvements

<Aside type="tip">
Save complex workflows as prompts in a "Workflows" note so you can easily repeat them.

## Conversation Patterns

### Iterative Refinement

Start broad, then narrow:

```
You: "What notes do I have about Python?"
AI: Shows 45 notes

You: "Just the ones about async programming"
AI: Filters to 8 notes

You: "Which of these are tutorials?"
AI: Identifies 3 tutorials

You: "Add #python-async tag to all of them"
AI: Tags 3 notes
```

### Chained Operations

Describe the full workflow:

> "Find all notes tagged #book, check which ones don't have a rating in frontmatter, and add rating=unrated to those"

The AI handles the multi-step process automatically.

### Exploratory Questions

Ask open-ended questions:

> "What are the most connected notes in my vault?"
> "Which topics do I write about most?"
> "What notes should probably be linked together?"
