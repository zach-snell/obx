This guide shows practical examples of using obsidian-go-mcp with AI assistants.

## Daily Workflows

### Morning Routine

**You**: "Set up my day - create today's daily note, show my open tasks, and list what I worked on yesterday"

The AI will:
1. Create/open today's daily note
2. Run `list-tasks` with `status=open`
3. Read yesterday's daily note for context

---

### End of Day Review

**You**: "Help me wrap up - show tasks I completed today, move any unfinished ones to tomorrow, and summarize what I accomplished"

The AI will:
1. List today's completed tasks
2. Identify incomplete tasks
3. Append them to tomorrow's daily note
4. Generate a summary for today's note

---

### Weekly Review

**You**: "Start my weekly review - show all tasks completed this week, any open items, and notes I created"

The AI will:
1. Open/create the weekly note
2. List daily notes from the past 7 days
3. Aggregate completed tasks
4. Find notes created this week
5. Summarize in the weekly note

## Note Management

### Quick Capture

**You**: "Add to my inbox: Research GraphQL vs REST for the new API"

```
→ append-note: inbox.md
→ Content: "- [ ] Research GraphQL vs REST for the new API"
```

---

### Create Structured Notes

**You**: "Create a new project note for 'Mobile App Redesign' with high priority, status planning, and due date March 15"

The AI will:
1. Create the note with `write-note`
2. Set frontmatter properties:
   - `priority: high`
   - `status: planning`
   - `due: 2024-03-15`

---

### Find and Update

**You**: "Find my note about the Q4 budget and update the status to approved"

```
1. search-vault: "Q4 budget"
2. set-frontmatter: path=found/note.md, key=status, value=approved
```

## Research Workflows

### Explore a Topic

**You**: "What do I know about machine learning? Show related notes and any gaps"

The AI will:
1. `search-vault`: "machine learning"
2. `search-by-tags`: "machine-learning"
3. `backlinks`: on main ML note
4. `orphan-notes`: check for isolated ML content
5. `suggest-links`: find potential connections

---

### Build a Knowledge Map

**You**: "Create a MOC for my programming notes and connect it to my main index"

```
1. generate-moc: directory=programming, output=programming/Programming MOC.md
2. append-note: Add link to main index
3. bulk-tag: Add #moc tag to the MOC
```

---

### Find Gaps

**You**: "What concepts in my vault need more development?"

```
1. find-stubs: max_words=50
2. broken-links: Find mentioned-but-not-created notes
3. orphan-notes: Find disconnected content
```

## Task Management

### Review All Tasks

**You**: "Show me all open tasks grouped by priority"

The AI will use `list-tasks` and organize results by priority tags or frontmatter.

---

### Task Cleanup

**You**: "Find all tasks older than 30 days and mark them for review"

```
1. list-tasks: status=open
2. Filter by date in task text or note modified date
3. bulk-tag: Add #needs-review to affected notes
```

---

### Project Tasks

**You**: "Show all tasks in my 'Website Redesign' project"

```
1. search-vault: In projects/Website Redesign/
2. list-tasks: directory=projects/Website Redesign
```

## Content Organization

### Reorganize a Folder

**You**: "The 'misc' folder is getting cluttered. Help me organize it by topic"

The AI might:
1. List notes in misc/
2. Analyze content and tags
3. Suggest categorization
4. Create new folders
5. `bulk-move` notes to appropriate locations

---

### Clean Up Tags

**You**: "I have tags #todo, #TODO, and #to-do. Standardize them all to #todo"

```
1. search-by-tags: each variant
2. For each note: Update tag format
3. Report: "Standardized 23 notes to use #todo"
```

---

### Archive Old Content

**You**: "Archive all notes in projects/ that haven't been modified in 6 months"

```
1. find-outdated: days=180, directory=projects
2. bulk-move: destination=archive/projects
3. bulk-set-frontmatter: status=archived
4. bulk-tag: add #archived
```

## Meeting Notes

### Before a Meeting

**You**: "Prepare for my meeting with the design team - create a note from the meeting template and pull in context from recent design discussions"

```
1. apply-template: meeting → meetings/Design Team 2024-01-15.md
2. search-vault: "design" in recent notes
3. append-note: Add relevant context to meeting note
```

---

### After a Meeting

**You**: "Extract action items from today's meeting notes and create tasks"

The AI will:
1. Read the meeting note
2. Identify action items (lines starting with "- [ ]" or "Action:")
3. Optionally distribute to relevant project notes

## Advanced Workflows

### Content Pipeline

**You**: "Show me all draft articles ready for review"

```
query-frontmatter: status=draft
→ Filter by: word count > 500, has all required sections
→ Present list for review
```

---

### Cross-Reference Check

**You**: "Are there any notes that mention 'API' but don't link to my API documentation?"

```
1. search-vault: "API"
2. For each result: check if it links to API-docs.md
3. Report unlinked mentions
4. Optionally: Add links
```

---

### Vault Health Check

**You**: "Run a full health check on my vault"

The AI will:
1. `vault-stats`: Overall metrics
2. `orphan-notes`: Disconnected content
3. `broken-links`: Missing link targets
4. `find-stubs`: Underdeveloped notes
5. `find-outdated`: Stale content
6. Report findings and suggest improvements

<Aside type="tip">
Save complex workflows as prompts in a "Workflows" note so you can easily repeat them.

## Conversation Patterns

### Iterative Refinement

Start broad, then narrow:

```
You: "What notes do I have about Python?"
AI: Shows 45 notes

You: "Just the ones about async programming"
AI: Filters to 8 notes

You: "Which of these are tutorials?"
AI: Identifies 3 tutorials

You: "Add #python-async tag to all of them"
AI: Tags 3 notes
```

### Chained Operations

Describe the full workflow:

> "Find all notes tagged #book, check which ones don't have a rating in frontmatter, and add rating=unrated to those"

The AI handles the multi-step process automatically.

### Exploratory Questions

Ask open-ended questions:

> "What are the most connected notes in my vault?"
> "Which topics do I write about most?"
> "What notes should probably be linked together?"
