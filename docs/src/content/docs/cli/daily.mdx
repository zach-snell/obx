The `obx daily` command is a shortcut for immediately creating or appending to today's daily note in your Obsidian vault.

## Usage

```bash
obx daily "Your thought or task here" [flags] [vault_path]
```

## Options

| Flag | Shorthand | Description | Default |
|------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `--folder` | `-d` | Target folder for daily notes | `daily` |
| `--format` | `-f` | Date format string (Go `time` package format) | `2006-01-02` |

## Examples

### Appending a thought

```bash
obx daily "Remember to check the pipeline logs"
```

If your daily note for today (e.g., `daily/2023-10-27.md`) exists, this will append the text to the bottom. If it doesn't exist, `obx` will create it and insert the text.

### Custom Formatting

To use a different folder structure or date format:

```bash
obx daily "Completed project review" --folder "Journal/2023" --format "01-02-2006"
```
