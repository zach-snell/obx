description: Search your Obsidian vault from the command line.
---

The `obx search` command allows you to perform full-text searches across your Obsidian vault. It's optimized for speed and provides output formats suitable for both human reading and scripting.

## Usage

```bash
obx search <query> [flags] [vault_path]
```

Or, if an active vault is configured:

```bash
obx search "machine learning"
```

## Options

| Flag | Shorthand | Description | Default |
|------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `--limit` | `-l` | Maximum number of results to return | `10` |
| `--dir` | `-d` | Restrict search to a specific directory inside the vault | |

## Examples

### Basic Search

```bash
obx search "meeting notes"
```

Output:
```text
Found 3 results:
- meetings/2023-10-25.md
- meetings/2023-10-26.md
- projects/website-redesign.md
```

### Searching within a Directory

To limit your search to a specific folder (e.g., `projects`):

```bash
obx search "TODO" -d projects
```

### Limiting Results

To get only the top 5 matches:

```bash
obx search "API key" -l 5
```
