import { Card, CardGrid, LinkCard } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

While `obx` is primarily an MCP server, it also provides a powerful command-line interface for interacting with your Obsidian vault directly from your terminal. This is useful for scripting, quick lookups, or vault maintenance without needing an AI assistant.

## Available Commands

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard
    title="obx search"
    description="Full-text search across your vault with compact or detailed output."
    href="/obx/cli/search"
  />
  <LinkCard
    title="obx doctor"
    description="Analyze your vault for broken links and orphaned notes."
    href="/obx/cli/doctor"
  />
  <LinkCard
    title="obx daily"
    description="Quickly create or append to your daily note."
    href="/obx/cli/daily"
  />
  <LinkCard
    title="obx vault"
    description="Manage your configured vault aliases globally."
    href="/obx/cli/vault"
  />
  <LinkCard
    title="obx mcp"
    description="Start the MCP server for AI clients."
    href="/obx/getting-started/configuration"
  />
</CardGrid>

## Global Flags

All `obx` commands support the following global options:

- `--help`, `-h`: Show help for a command.

## Environment Variables

You can configure `obx` behavior using environment variables to avoid passing flags repeatedly:

- **`OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH`**: Sets the default vault path if one is not provided as an argument and no active vault is configured via `obx vault`.
- **`OBSIDIAN_ADDR`**: Sets the HTTP address for `obx mcp --http`.
