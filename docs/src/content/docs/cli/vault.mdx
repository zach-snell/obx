description: Manage named vault configurations globally.

The `obx vault` command allows you to define aliases for your Obsidian vaults. This enables you to switch between vaults easily and configure dynamic vault switching for the MCP server.

Configuration is stored in `~/.config/obx/config.json`.

## Usage

```bash
obx vault [command]
```

## Available Commands

### add

Registers a new vault alias globally.

```bash
obx vault add my-notes /Users/zach/Documents/MyNotes
```

### list

Lists all established vault aliases and displays the currently active default vault.

```bash
obx vault list
```

Output:
```text
Available vaults:
  my-notes: /Users/zach/Documents/MyNotes
  work: /Users/zach/Documents/WorkVault (active)
```

### switch

Changes the default active vault for the CLI. If `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_PATH` is not set and no path argument is provided to a command, `obx` will use this active vault.

```bash
obx vault switch my-notes
```

## Dynamic Vault Switching

These aliases are not just for CLI convenience. If you want your AI assistant to switch between multiple vaults autonomously over the MCP protocol without restarting the server, you can pass these aliases to `obx mcp`:

```bash
obx mcp --allow-vault-switching --allowed-vaults my-notes,work
```

This ensures the agent can only access paths you have explicitly authorized.
